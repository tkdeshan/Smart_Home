## Introduction

This is the prototype of a smart home system that can securely control lights, switches, gates, and doors using a mobile phone. It utilizes sensors to detect objects and flames, displaying the overall security status on the mobile phone.

## Getting Started

1. Connect the hardware according to the circuit diagram included in the diagram folder.
2. Set up the Arduino IDE to program the ESP32 Devkit v1 board.
3. Modify the Wi-Fi credentials with the actual ones.
4. Upload the program to the ESP32 board.
5. Copy the IP address from the serial monitor and open it using a browser.

## Usage

- Control lights and switches using particular buttons.
- Control the gate and door using specific buttons (before that, provide the correct password).
- Ability to see the security and fire state and overall states in the control elements.
